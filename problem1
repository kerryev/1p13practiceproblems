# Problem: Write a function that computes the transaction fees and penalties charged by a bank at the end of the month.

The function should compute the amount of penalties a bank charges for a customer.
○ If the account balance is below $2,500.00 then a one time monthly fee of $X is deducted from the account balance.
○ If the number of transactions at the end of the month is below 2 or above 10 then a transaction fee of $(Y*number
of transactions) is deducted from the account balance.
○ If the credit score of the customer is below 300, then:
■ X = 20
■ Y = 5
○ Otherwise:
■ X = 10
■ Y = 2
● The function should return the updated account balance at the end of the month (after the penalties were deducted).
○ If account balance is negative, return the string, "Your balance is negative"
